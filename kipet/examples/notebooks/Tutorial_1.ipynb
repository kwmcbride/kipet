Where “nfe” is the number of finite elements, the higher the number the more accurate your solution is likely to be but at the cost of higher computational costs. “ncp” is the number of collocation points within each finite element. As this number increases, the computational costs increase dramatically and the chances of a converged/feasible solution decrease. The “scheme” refers to the type of collocation to be applied, with two options available to users, either collocation using Lagrange-Radau (as above) roots or using Lagrange-Legendre (scheme=’LAGRANGE-LEGENDRE’). It is highly recommended that the user use Lagrange-Radau (which is also the default option if the argument is omitted) as this has been shown to produce more numerical stability for complex problems, such as the ones usually encountered in KIPET.
